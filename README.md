### Book Recommendation System Project

Developed a book recommendation system using collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. Created a model to recommend similar books based on titles. Built a website where users can view the top 50 books and navigate to a recommendation bar for personalized suggestions. The front-end was designed with HTML and CSS, while the back-end was powered by Flask and Gunicorn. Utilized various Python libraries for recommendation algorithms and data processing.
